This folder contains the code to pre-process data, train neural operators, and post-process outputs. 

### Training the models
Models FNO, U-NO, G-FNO, and F-FNO can be trained with the default options by running `models.train_fno3d.py`, `models.train_uno3d.py`, `models.train_gfno3d.py`, and `models.train_ffno3d.py`. The provided code supports CPU and single-GPU training.
