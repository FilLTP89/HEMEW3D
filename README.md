# HEMEW3D
Code to run 3D simulations of the elastic wave equation with the earthquake simulator SEM3D.

To create the materials and run the simulation, SEM3D must be installed from this [github code](https://github.com/sem3d/SEM). 

The notebook `Read_data.ipynb` can be used directly with the files downloaded on the "Recherche Data Gouv" repository.
